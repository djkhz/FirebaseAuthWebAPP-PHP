# FirebaseAuthWebAPP-PHP

This is a simple approach to protect pages and content with PHP, even if Javascript has been deactivated by the user. If you knew the absolute path to "/pages/profile.php", you could still read the content so far. If no current session is open you will now be directed back to the start page "index.php".
